# cPanelTools CHANGELOG
Changes V1.1
 Added dnsFix.py, script for fixing dns zones and the communication with gmail servers since they implemented
 strict delivery rules
 This can be extended for any bulk dns modifications on any cPanel server

 # configuration file:
 Moved 'ns_ipranges' from [SATerminator] to [Server] section for easier integration with new scripts that rely on dns

== dnsFix.py (v0.5)
So far scripts only collects data, without changing anything.
Output goes to STDOUT, so pipe it to get a log.
In 1.0 version this will fix MX and TXT records for active domains resolving to cPanel server to comply with Gmail new
standards.


CHANGES V1.0
 - Renamed from Server-Maintenance.
 Reasons?
 Playing around with git repos, thinking about the direction I want this to go, and so on...
